Printf problems when not printing Newline.. Something with buffer. 
So it wasnt a problem with mlx looping.
printf requires \n to print immediately.
if mlx loop is not present, program terminates and buffer is cleared
and printed. Else it is stuck in buffer until program terminates and
only after that is printed.
