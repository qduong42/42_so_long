# so_long - @42Wolfsburg

## About

Coding a simple 2D game with 42minilbX library from 42Paris. Uses X11 through a "custom Simplified X-Window (X11R6) programming API written in C."


- Basic game with Player, Walls, Exits, Collectibles
- terminal_only branch provides the possibility to play a terminal implementation of the game without minilibX.
- Showcase step by step implementation of logic and only then implemented it in minilibX.

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
The only requirements are:
- GNU make (v3.81)
- GCC (12.0.0) (clang-1200.0.32.28)

Those versions are the ones used during development.

### Building the program

        git clone https://github.com/qduong42/42_so_long
2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`

### Running the program

`./so_long maps/[map_name]`

Basic maps are there.

## Main Project Instructions

### Mandatory

- Only use C
- Must respect the 42 imposed coding style The Norminator
- No memory leaks
